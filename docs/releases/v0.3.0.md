# Tea Timer Card v0.3.0

> Release date: 2026-02-20 • Minimum Home Assistant: 2024.7.0

## Highlights

- Touch-first UX refresh driven by a structured 23-scenario audit. The card now keeps a more stable control shell across common transitions and improves action predictability.
- Improved information density and readability: a larger dial, fewer duplicated status labels, and tighter action grouping while preserving touch-safe targets.
- Better resilience in real-world kiosk environments: added finished-state fallback logic when a `timer.finished` event is delayed or missed.

## Install / Update

1. Review the [release checklist](../release-checklist.md) to confirm quality gates and release sign-off for this build.
2. Install via HACS (custom repository) or download the assets attached to the
   [Tea Timer Card v0.3.0 release](https://github.com/sharwell/ha-tea-timer/releases/tag/v0.3.0):
   `tea-timer-card.js`, `tea-timer-card.<hash>.js`, optional `tea-timer-card.<hash>.js.map`, and `checksums.txt`.
3. Verify SHA-256 checksums before copying files into `<config>/www/` for manual installs.
4. Ensure your Lovelace resource points at `/local/tea-timer-card.js`; the stable loader imports the
   fingerprinted bundle packaged with this release.

## Notable behavior changes

- Card-body tap start is now idle-only. Restart while running/paused requires explicit action controls.
- Queued preset and custom-duration context moved into the primary action secondary line.
- Transient state and entity errors render as overlays to reduce layout reflow.
- Running/paused controls use a consistent dial-plus-rail arrangement with larger, touch-safe targets.

## Compatibility

- Minimum Home Assistant core: **2024.7.0**.
- Existing v0.2.x YAML remains compatible; no breaking configuration changes.
- New optional config: `cardBodyTapStart` (default `true`) for controlling idle card-body tap start behavior.

## Known limitations

- Home Assistant cores without native `timer.pause` still require the optional `input_text.<entity>_paused_remaining`
  helper to expose pause/resume controls.
- Browser resource cache refresh may still be required after updating bundled assets.

## Troubleshooting & docs

- Review [Getting Started](../getting-started.md) for installation and first-run checks.
- See [State & actions](../state-and-actions.md) for current interaction semantics.
- Refer to [Touch UX audit](../ux-audit.md) for scenario evidence and rationale behind this release’s layout and interaction changes.
- Use [Automate on `timer.finished`](../automations/finished.md) for automation patterns and edge-case notes.

## Feedback

- File bugs or regression reports at the [issue tracker](https://github.com/sharwell/ha-tea-timer/issues).
- For release-specific feedback, include screenshots, viewport width, platform/browser, and whether Home Assistant is running in kiosk mode.
