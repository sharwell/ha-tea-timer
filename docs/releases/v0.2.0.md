# Tea Timer Card v0.2.0

> Release date: 2025-10-14 • Minimum Home Assistant: 2024.7.0

## Highlights

- Pause and resume running brews with native `timer.pause` support, plus an automatic fallback to the optional
  `input_text` helper for older Home Assistant cores. The countdown overlay freezes while paused and resumes from the
  authoritative remaining time.
- Extend an active brew without resetting the dial. The new **+1 minute** control prefers `timer.change` and gracefully
  falls back to a restart when the service is unavailable or would exceed Home Assistant’s cap.
- Toggle a built-in debug overlay to visualize baseline seeds, clock skew adjustments, and extend events when
  investigating timing drift.
- Configure the card directly from the Lovelace Visual Editor using the presets-aware form while keeping YAML parity for
  advanced options.

## Install / Update

1. Review the [release checklist](../release-checklist.md) to confirm the quality gates completed for this build.
2. Install via HACS (custom repository) or download the assets attached to the
   [Tea Timer Card v0.2.0 release](https://github.com/sharwell/ha-tea-timer/releases/tag/v0.2.0):
   `tea-timer-card.js`, `tea-timer-card.<hash>.js`, optional `tea-timer-card.<hash>.js.map`, and `checksums.txt`.
3. Verify the SHA-256 checksums before copying files into `<config>/www/` for manual installs.
4. Ensure your Lovelace resources reference `/local/tea-timer-card.js` so the stable loader imports the fingerprinted
   bundle delivered with this release.

## Compatibility

- Minimum Home Assistant core: **2024.7.0** (validated on `core-2024.7.3`).
- Tested browsers & devices:
  - Windows 11: Chrome 127, Microsoft Edge 127
  - macOS Sonoma: Firefox 128
  - iOS 17.5 (iPhone 14): Safari
  - Android 14 (Pixel 7): Chrome
- Network profiles: LAN (<20 ms), 200 ms/2% loss latency simulation, and intermittent Wi-Fi recover the WebSocket and
  countdown without falling out of sync.
- See the [QA matrix](../qa-matrix.md) for full evidence and scenario coverage.

## Known limitations

- Home Assistant cores without native `timer.pause` still require the optional `input_text.<entity>_paused_remaining`
  helper to surface pause/resume controls.
- Restart confirmation remains optional and off by default; mid-run cancel is not yet implemented.
- After updating assets you may need to reload the Lovelace resource cache to pick up the new fingerprinted bundle.

## Troubleshooting

- Consult the [Troubleshooting guide](../troubleshooting.md) for common configuration or resource-loading issues.
- The debug overlay (enabled via developer tools) logs baseline deltas and extend events if you need deeper insight while
  investigating skew.
- For installation guidance, see the [Getting Started walkthrough](../getting-started.md) and
  [Automate on `timer.finished`](../automations/finished.md) for automation patterns.

## Feedback & support

- File issues or feature requests on the [Tea Timer Card issue tracker](https://github.com/sharwell/ha-tea-timer/issues).
- For community discussion or questions, start a thread in the repository’s Discussions tab.
- If packaging problems arise, the rollback plan is to re-issue updated assets or cut a `v0.2.1` hotfix following the same
  checklist.
