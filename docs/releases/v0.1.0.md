# Tea Timer Card v0.1.0

## What’s in the MVD
- Circular brew dial with keyboard and pointer controls.
- Configurable preset chips with queued restarts and shared state across dashboards.
- Start/restart tap target, multi-device sync via the bound Home Assistant `timer` entity, and the five-second “Done” overlay.
- Accessibility polish: reduced-motion fallbacks, screen reader announcements, and full keyboard navigation.

## Install / Update
- Download the assets attached to this release (`tea-timer-card.js`, `tea-timer-card.<hash>.js`, and optional source maps) or install through HACS.
- Copy the files into `<config>/www/` (manual install) or let HACS update the Lovelace resource.
- Reference `/local/tea-timer-card.js` in your Lovelace resources. The stable loader imports the fingerprinted bundle so browsers refresh when the hash changes.
- Verify integrity by comparing each file against the published `checksums.txt` (SHA-256).
- New to the card? Follow the [Getting Started guide](../getting-started.md).

## Known limitations
- No mid-run extend or `+1 minute` action yet.
- Pause and resume controls are out of scope for the MVD.
- Browser refresh is required after updating resources so the new bundle loads.

## Troubleshooting & documentation
- Review [Automate on finish](../automations/finished.md) for automation examples and failure modes.
- Additional guidance: [Troubleshooting](../troubleshooting.md) and [FAQ](../faq.md).

## Compatibility statement
