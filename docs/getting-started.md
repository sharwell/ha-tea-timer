# Tea Timer Card â€” Getting Started

This is a placeholder for the Tea Timer Card documentation. Future updates will include installation and configuration guidance.

## Dial duration options

- `minDurationSeconds` (default `15`) sets the minimum selectable brew time.
- `maxDurationSeconds` (default `1200`) caps the dial at 20 minutes by default.
- `stepSeconds` (default `5`) controls the rounding increment for pointer and keyboard input.
- The dial is interactive only while the timer is idle; pressing the arrow keys or PageUp/PageDown nudges the value by the configured steps.
